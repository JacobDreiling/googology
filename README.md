# googology
A compilation of extremely fast-growing functions. Most of them were defined by professionals but some are personal creations. In the spirit of busy beavers, each function has been written as short and condensed as possible.

The top method is a helper function that can be used to view a function's calculations step by step.

The name of each function/notation is provided, as well as its strength in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy">fast-growing hierarchy</a> and character length. Each program is sorted first by its growth rate, followed by its length.
