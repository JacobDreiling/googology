Python implementations of a variety of extremely fast-growing functions. In the spirit of busy beavers, each function has been written using as few non-whitespace characters as possible.

The top method is a helper function that can be used to view the calculation of any of the fast-growing functions, step by step.

The name of each function/notation is provided, as well as its strength in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy">fast-growing hierarchy</a> and character length. Each program is sorted first by its growth rate, followed by its length.
